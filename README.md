# SIR
### overview

It's a SIR model for novel coronavirus with Eigen which is a C++ library for matrix operations.

You can simulate the situation of the spread of novel coronavirus by using method createData() in main.cpp and then calculate R0 by using method getRes() in main.cpp using generated data. Or you can use your own data to calculate R0 by using method getRes() which reads data from data document.   

----

### data

I.txt is the daily amount of infected people.  
R.txt is the daily amount of recovered people.  
S.txt is the amount of susceptible people

----

### Variable

The variable I in method createDate() is the initial number of infected people.  
Variable S is the initial number of people who are susceptible.  
Variable N is the amount of the people.   
Variable R is the initial number of people who are cured.  
Variable Pcon is the probability to contact others.   
Variable Pspr is the probability to spread the novel coronavirus when people are contacted with each other.  
Variable Prec is the probability to recover.  
Variable iter is number of iterations which means the time of the model.

### PS

PS:If you use Xcode, you can open the SIR.xcodeproj directly. If not, you can open SIR document, all of resource is in it.
